Please implement the VIVO FIFO in rtl/vivo_fifo.sv.

All behavior is defined in docs/Specifications.md. Your RTL must follow every rule in that document with no missing cases or added assumptions.

The module name must be "vivo_fifo". It has these parameters:

    ELEM_WIDTH      : bit width per element
    IN_ELEMS_MAX    : max elements accepted in one push
    OUT_ELEMS_MAX   : max elements returned in one pop
    DEPTH_ELEMS     : total FIFO capacity in elements

Clock: posedge clk  
Reset: rst_n (active low, async, must fully reset state)

Input (push) interface:
    - in_valid / in_ready handshake
    - in_data packed, oldest element in the lowest index
    - in_num_elems gives number of elements this push (0 to IN_ELEMS_MAX)
    - push happens only if in_valid && in_ready
    - if not enough space, in_ready must be low and nothing is stored

Output (pop) interface:
    - out_valid / out_ready handshake
    - out_req_elems requests elements to pop (0 to OUT_ELEMS_MAX)
    - pop happens only if out_valid && out_ready
    - if fewer elements than requested are stored, out_valid must be low
    - out_data must output oldest elements first into [0]
    - out_num_elems must equal out_req_elems on a successful pop

Push and pop may both occur in the same cycle, and ordering must always be correct.

Internal logic must wrap pointers modulo DEPTH_ELEMS. No elements may be dropped, duplicated, or reordered.

Only synthesizable SystemVerilog is allowed. Do not use behavioral queues, dynamic arrays, DPI, classes, or anything that infers latches.

You may only edit rtl/vivo_fifo.sv.
